  abstract = {A multi-hop network of wireless sensors can be used to gather spatio-temporal samples of a physical phenomenon and transmit these samples to a processing center. This paper addresses the important issue of minimizing the number of transmissions required to gather one sample from each sensor. The technique used to minimize communication costs combines analytical results from stochastic geometry with a distributed, randomized algorithm for generating clusters of sensors. The minimum communication energy achieved by this approach is significantly lower than the energy costs incurred in non-clustered networks and in clustered networks produced by such algorithms as the Max–Min d-cluster algorithm.}

  abstract  = {High-performance applications running on current and future architectures are mostly performance-limited by the cost of data movement, vertically through the memory hierarchy of a node or between CPU host and accelerator, and horizontally across nodes. In this talk, we discuss the role of packed data layout in optimizing data movement across a variety of different architectures (CPU and GPU) and memory systems. Conceptually, a high performance application is defined as operations on a unit of data and parallelism that is designed for efficient vertical and horizontal data movement, and can be tailored to match the requirements of an application and target architecture. Integrating data layout abstractions and optimizations into programming systems provides critical technology for achieving performance portability across the diversity of high-performance architectures arising in the exascale era.},

This paper presents an easy and inexpensive implementation of such a system using four commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) infrared (IR) light emitting diode (LED) emitters and two COTS IR receivers on each of two docking plates. The angular intensity distribution of an emitter and the sensitivity distribution of a receiver allow for estimation of the angle and distance between them. Simple experiments have been conducted indicating that such a setup is able to give positional offset in any of 6 degrees of error (x, y, z, pitch, roll, and yaw) within a range. A theoretical framework is also established using least squares minimization. The theoretical framework is general and applies to other configurations of emitter and receiver parts and positioning.},

  abstract = {The CVORG group at the University of Delaware is responsible for designing and developing a test platform for the operation and characterization of a 512×512 array of infrared LED emitters. This platform consists mainly of an integrated circuit responsible for driving current to the LEDs, a package to which the driver and LEDs can be mounted, and a cryogenic dewar used to run tests at 77K. The fabrication of the driver read-in integrated circuit, or RIIC, was completed using a 0.5$\mu$m CMOS process from OnSemiconductor. Because of the size of the array, stitching techniques were used to create the 3.3cm×3.3cm chip. The cryogenic package is a custom 6-layer printed circuit board (PCB) plated in a soft wire-bondable gold. Finally, modifications were made to the cryogenic dewar to allow us to properly interface with the RIIC.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Currently, precise stereotactic radiosurgery delivery is possible with the Gamma Knife or floor-stand linear accelerator (linac) systems. Couch-mounted linac radiosurgery systems, while less expensive and more flexible than other radiosurgery delivery systems, have not demonstrated a comparable level of precision. This article reports on the development and testing of an optically guided positioning system designed to improve the precision of patient localization in couch-mounted linac radiosurgery systems. Methods and Materials: The optically guided positioning system relies on detection of infrared light-emitting diodes (IRLEDs) attached to a standard target positioner. The IRLEDs are monitored by a commercially available camera system that is interfaced to a personal computer. An IRLED reference is established at the center of stereotactic space, and the computer reports the current position of the IRLEDs relative to this reference position. Using this readout from the computer, the correct stereotactic coordinate can be set directly. Results: Bench testing was performed to compare the accuracy of the optically guided system with that of a floor-stand system, that can be considered an absolute reference. This testing showed that coordinate localization using the IRLED system to track translations agreed with the absolute to within 0.1 ± 0.1 mm. As rotations for noncoplanar couch angles were included, the inaccuracy was increased to 0.2 ± 0.1 mm. Conclusions: IRLED technology improves the accuracy of patient localization relative to the linac isocenter in comparison with conventional couch-mounted systems. Further, the patient’s position can be monitored in real time as the couch is rotated for all treatment angles. Thus, any errors introduced by couch inaccuracies can be detected and corrected.}

  abstract = {The technology used to implement CO2 sensors depends on the requirements in terms of sensitivity, price and robustness. The most common technology for highly sensitive tasks are based on tunable diode laser spectroscopy, while so-called non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) photometers [2] are used in less demanding scenarios such as control air conditioning systems. Most NDIR systems use thermal emitters as light source which are readily available at low cost but require compensation for cross-sensitivities toward other gas species. The detector technology employed in these systems ranges from photodiodes to thermopiles and pyroelectric detectors, all of which require the use of spectral filters to avoid cross sensitivities. Here we present a low-cost photoacoustic-based detector comprised of a microphone in a hermetically sealed chamber filled with CO2. To excite sound waves a MID-IR LED emitting radiation in the strong CO2 absorption region around 4.2μm is used for the first time.}

  abstract = {Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have enjoyed significant progress in terms of practical applications; however, their lifetimes are often limited by poor thermal stability. These authors have monitored the surface temperature of working OLED devices and identified “hot spots” due to electrical shorting using an infrared imaging and analysis system. Thermal breakdown in the devices is shown to have its origins in the electric-field-induced decomposition of indium tin oxide and electromigration of indium through the organic layer under high electric field.},
