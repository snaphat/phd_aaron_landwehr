We report on the design and testing of a 2-color dynamic scene projector system based on the MIRAGE-XL infrared scene projector. The system is based on the optical combination of two 1024x1024 MIRAGE-XL resistive arrays. Algorithms derived for 2-color operation are discussed and system performance data is presented, including radiometric performance, sub-pixel spatial co-registration and compensation for spectral cross-talk.

@article{franks1,
abstract = {
The rapid development of very-large format infrared detector arrays has challenged the IR scene projector community to develop correspondingly larger-format infrared emitter arrays to support the testing needs of systems incorporating these detectors. As with most integrated circuits, fabrication yields for the read-in integrated circuit (RIIC) that drives the emitter pixel array are expected to drop dramatically with increasing size, making monolithic RIICs larger than the current 1024x1024 format impractical and unaffordable. Additionally, many scene projector users require much higher simulated temperatures than current technology can generate to fully evaluate the performance of their systems and associated processing algorithms. Under the Ultra High Temperature (UHT) development program, Santa Barbara Infrared Inc. (SBIR) is developing a new infrared scene projector architecture capable of producing both very large format ({\textgreater}1024x1024) resistive emitter arrays and improved emitter pixel technology capable of simulating very high apparent temperatures. During an earlier phase of the program, SBIR demonstrated materials with MWIR apparent temperatures in excess of 1000K. New emitter materials have subsequently been selected to produce pixels that achieve even higher apparent temperatures. Test results from pixels fabricated using the new material set will be presented and discussed. Also in development under the same UHT program is a 'scalable' RIIC that will be used to drive the high temperature pixels. This RIIC will utilize through-silicon vias (TSVs) and quilt packaging (QP) technologies to allow seamless tiling of multiple chips to fabricate very large arrays, and thus overcome the inherent yield limitations of very-large-scale integrated circuits. Current status of the RIIC development effort will also be presented.

Several new technologies have been developed over recent years that make a fundamental change in the scene projection for infrared hardware in the loop test. Namely many of the innovations are in Read In Integrated Circuit (RIIC) architecture, which can lead to an operational and cost effective solution for producing large emitter arrays based on the assembly of smaller sub-arrays. Array sizes of 2048x2048 and larger are required to meet the high fidelity test needs of today's modern infrared sensors. The Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) Test and Evaluation/Science and Technology (T and E/S and T) Program through the U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentations (PEO STRI) has contracted with SBIR and its partners to investigate integrating new technologies in order to achieve array sizes much larger than are available today. SBIR and its partners have undertaken several proof-of-concept experiments that provide the groundwork for producing a tiled emitter array. Herein we will report on the results of these experiments, including the demonstration of edge connections formed between different ICs with a gap of less than 10µm.

To meet the needs of high fidelity infrared sensors, under the Ultra High Temperature (UHT) development program, Santa Barbara Infrared Inc. (SBIR) has developed new infrared emitter materials capable of achieving extremely high temperatures. The current state of the art arrays based on the MIRAGE-XL generation of scene projectors is capable of producing imagery with mid-wave infrared (MWIR) apparent temperatures up to 700K with response times of 5 ms. The Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) Test and Evaluation/Science and Technology (TandE/SandT) Program through the U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentations (PEO STRI) has contracted with SBIR and its partners to develop a new resistive array based on these new materials, using a high current Read-In Integrated Circuit (RIIC) capable of achieving higher temperatures as well as faster frame rates. The status of that development will be detailed within this paper, including performance data from prototype pixels.

abstract = {The CVORG group at the University of Delaware is responsible for designing and developing a test platform for the operation and characterization of a 512×512 array of infrared LED emitters. This platform consists mainly of an integrated circuit responsible for driving current to the LEDs, a package to which the driver and LEDs can be mounted, and a cryogenic dewar used to run tests at 77K. The fabrication of the driver read-in integrated circuit, or RIIC, was completed using a 0.5$\mu$m CMOS process from OnSemiconductor. Because of the size of the array, stitching techniques were used to create the 3.3cm×3.3cm chip. The cryogenic package is a custom 6-layer printed circuit board (PCB) plated in a soft wire-bondable gold. Finally, modifications were made to the cryogenic dewar to allow us to properly interface with the RIIC.},

abstract = {Since the early 1990s, there has been major progress in the developing field of dynamic infrared scene projection, driven principally by the need for hardware-in-the-loop simulation of the oncoming generation of imaging infrared missile seekers and more recently by the needs for realistic simulation of the new generation of thermal imagers and forward-looking infrared systems. In this paper the current status of the dynamic infrared projection field is reviewed, commencing with an outline of its history. The requirements for dynamic infrared scene projection are examined, allowing a set of validity criteria to be developed. Each class of infrared projector that has been investigated—emissive, transmissive, reflective, laser scanner and phosphor—together with the specific technology initiatives within the class is described and examined against the validity criteria. In this way the leading dynamic infrared scene projection technologies are identified.}

abstract={Six DOF offset sensing between two plates is important for automatic docking mechanisms. This paper presents an easy and inexpensive implementation of such a system using four commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) infrared (IR) light emitting diode (LED) emitters and two COTS IR receivers on each of two docking plates. The angular intensity distribution of an emitter and the sensitivity distribution of a receiver allow for estimation of the angle and distance between them. Simple experiments have been conducted indicating that such a setup is able to give positional offset in any of 6 degrees of error (x, y, z, pitch, roll, and yaw) within a range. A theoretical framework is also established using least squares minimization. The theoretical framework is general and applies to other configurations of emitter and receiver parts and positioning.},
