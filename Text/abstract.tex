%FIXME: get rid of we
Traditional display protocols have limitations in terms of fixed frame rates, high bandwidth requirements, and precise control over the display of frames. We propose a novel scalable packetized display protocol architecture incorporating dynamic frame rates, high-speed capabilities, and dynamic synchronization to bridge performance gaps. We further provide a modular FPGA implementation of the architecture for use on array emitters.
